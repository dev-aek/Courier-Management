The site is opened from this link, but data processing cannot be done. 
To do this, db.pgerd and db.sql files need to be processed via postgre.
In addition, it is necessary to run the backend files on an IDE.
Site link is https://courier-management-project-estu-ceng.netlify.app/

Note!
There may be problems with the site in the link, you will need to "npm start" 
from the terminal by entering the fronted project where we have the source file.
